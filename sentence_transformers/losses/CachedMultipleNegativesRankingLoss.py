        Boosted version of :class:`MultipleNegativesRankingLoss` (https://huggingface.co/papers/1705.00652) by GradCache (https://huggingface.co/papers/2101.06983).

        Constrastive learning (here our MNRL loss) with in-batch negatives is usually hard to work with large batch sizes due to (GPU) memory limitation.
        Even with batch-scaling methods like gradient-scaling, it cannot work either. This is because the in-batch negatives make the data points within
        the same batch non-independent and thus the batch cannot be broke down into mini-batches. GradCache is a smart way to solve this problem.
        It achieves the goal by dividing the computation into two stages of embedding and loss calculation, which both can be scaled by mini-batches.
        As a result, memory of constant size (e.g. that works with batch size = 32) can now process much larger batches (e.g. 65536).

        In detail:

            (1) It first does a quick embedding step without gradients/computation graphs to get all the embeddings;
            (2) Calculate the loss, backward up to the embeddings and cache the gradients wrt. to the embeddings;
            (3) A 2nd embedding step with gradients/computation graphs and connect the cached gradients into the backward chain.

        Notes: All steps are done with mini-batches. In the original implementation of GradCache, (2) is not done in mini-batches and
        requires a lot memory when the batch size is large. One drawback is about the speed. Gradient caching will sacrifice
        around 20% computation time according to the paper.

        See :class:`MultipleNegativesRankingLoss` for more details about the underlying loss itself.

        Args:
            model: SentenceTransformer model
            scale: Output of similarity function is multiplied by scale value. In some literature, the scaling parameter
                is referred to as temperature, which is the inverse of the scale. In short: ``scale = 1 / temperature``, so
                ``scale=20.0`` is equivalent to ``temperature=0.05``. A higher scale (lower temperature) puts more emphasis
                on the positive example, and values between 10 and 100 are common.
            similarity_fct: similarity function between sentence embeddings. By default, cos_sim. Can also be set to dot
                product (and then set scale to 1)
            mini_batch_size: Mini-batch size for the forward pass, this denotes how much memory is actually used during
                training and evaluation. The larger the mini-batch size, the more memory efficient the training is, but
                the slower the training will be. It's recommended to set it as high as your GPU memory allows. The default
                value is 32.
            gather_across_devices: If True, gather the embeddings across all devices before computing the loss.
                Recommended when training on multiple GPUs, as it allows for larger batch sizes, but it may slow down
                training due to communication overhead, and can potentially lead to out-of-memory errors.
            directions: Which similarity interaction terms to include in the loss. Options:

                - "query_to_doc": query -> all documents (always included as it covers the paired positive).
                - "query_to_query": query -> all other queries in the batch.
                - "doc_to_query": document -> all queries (symmetric term).
                - "doc_to_doc": document -> all other documents in the batch, excluding those belonging to the same query.

                The default ("query_to_doc",) matches the standard MultipleNegativesRankingLoss / InfoNCE behavior.
            partition_mode: How to normalize the scores (the softmax denominator):
                - "joint": One joint softmax over all selected directions.
                - "per_direction": One softmax per direction. A loss is computed for each direction and then averaged.
            show_progress_bar: If True, a progress bar for the mini-batches is shown during training. The default is False.
            hardness_alpha: Hyperparameter controlling the strength of hardness-weighted contrastive learning,
                following `Lan et al. 2025 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04812>`_. Higher values emphasize harder
                negatives more. Recommended value is 5.0. Set to 0.0 to disable (default).
            hardness_mode: Strategy for applying hardness weighting:

                - ``"all"``: Adds ``alpha * stop_grad(cos_sim)`` to every negative logit inside the softmax
                  (Lan et al. 2025, Eq. 5). Works with all data formats including pairs-only.
                - ``"hard_only"``: Weights each sample's loss by the hardness of its explicit hard negative(s)
                  via ``w_i = exp(alpha * stop_grad(max_cos_sim))``. Only active when explicit negatives are provided.

                Defaults to ``"all"``.

        Requirements:
            1. (anchor, positive) pairs, (anchor, positive, negative) triplets, or (anchor, positive, negative_1, ..., negative_n) n-tuples
            2. Should be used with large `per_device_train_batch_size` and low `mini_batch_size` for superior performance, but slower training time than :class:`MultipleNegativesRankingLoss`.

        Recommendations:
            - Use ``BatchSamplers.NO_DUPLICATES`` (:class:`docs <sentence_transformers.training_args.BatchSamplers>`) to
              ensure that no in-batch negatives are duplicates of the anchor or positive samples.

        Relations:
            - Equivalent to :class:`MultipleNegativesRankingLoss`, but with caching that allows for much higher batch sizes
              (and thus better performance) without extra memory usage. This loss also trains roughly 2x to 2.4x slower than
              :class:`MultipleNegativesRankingLoss`.
